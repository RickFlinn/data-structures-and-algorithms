This is a repository containing my solutions to the code challenges I was assigned in the CodeFellows 401 C#/.NET course. 



## [ArrayShift](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/ArrayShift)
Take in an array of integers and an integer, and returning a new array consisting of the original
array shifted to accommodate the given integer in its center.


## [ArrayBinarySearch](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/ArrayBinarySearch)
Perform a binary search on a sorted array of integers for a search key, returning the index where it was found,
or -1 if the search key does not exist in the array.
