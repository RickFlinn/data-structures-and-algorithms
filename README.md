This is a repository containing my solutions to the code challenges I was assigned in the CodeFellows 401 C#/.NET course. 



## [ArrayShift](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/ArrayShift)
Take in an array of integers and an integer, and returning a new array consisting of the original
array shifted to accommodate the given integer in its center.


## [ArrayBinarySearch](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/ArrayBinarySearch)
Perform a binary search on a sorted array of integers for a search key, returning the index where it was found,
or -1 if the search key does not exist in the array.

## [LinkedList](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/LinkedLists/LinkedList)
Create a class for singly linked lists and nodes, with methods allowing for node insertion, printing the values contained in a linked list to console, and checking whether a value is stored in a node within the linked list. 



## [KthFromEnd](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/LinkedLists/kthFromEnd/KthFromEnd)
Add a new method to the LinkedList class that takes in an integer k and returns the value kth from the end of the array.

## [Merge Linked Lists](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/LinkedLists/LinkedList_Merge)
Create a static method that merges two Linked Lists, "zipping" their values together, and returns the merged list.

## [Stacks and Queues](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Data-Structures/StacksNQueues/StacksAndQueues)

Defines standalone Classes for Stacks and Queues.

## [Animal Shelter](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/AnimalShelter/Animal_Shelter_Challenge)
Create an Animal Shelter class that only accepts `Cat`s or `Dog`s, and can Dequeue a `Cat`, a `Dog`, or the animal that has been in the shelter the longest. 

## [MultiBracketValidation](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/MultiBracketValidation/MultiBracketValidation)
Verify if a given string contains code-valid bracket pairings. 

## [Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Data-Structures/Tree/Binary_Tree)
Defines classes for the BinaryTree and BinarySearchTree data structures. 

## [FizzBuzzTree](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/FizzBuzzTree/FizzBuzzTree)
Replaces all the integer values in a binary tree with "Fizz" if they are divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if 
divisible by both. 

## [BreadthFirst](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/BreadthFirst)
Write a method that performs a breadth-first traversal on a binary tree, and printing its values to console. 

## [FindMaxValue](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/FindMaxValue)
Write a method that returns the maximum value in a Binary Tree of numeric values.
