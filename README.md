This is a repository containing my solutions to the code challenges I was assigned in the CodeFellows 401 C#/.NET course. 



## [ArrayShift](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/ArrayShift)
Take in an array of integers and an integer, and returning a new array consisting of the original
array shifted to accommodate the given integer in its center.


## [ArrayBinarySearch](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/ArrayBinarySearch)
Perform a binary search on a sorted array of integers for a search key, returning the index where it was found,
or -1 if the search key does not exist in the array.

## [LinkedList](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/LinkedLists/LinkedList)
Create a class for singly linked lists and nodes, with methods allowing for node insertion, printing the values contained in a linked list to console, and checking whether a value is stored in a node within the linked list. 



## [KthFromEnd](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/LinkedLists/kthFromEnd/KthFromEnd)
Add a new method to the LinkedList class that takes in an integer k and returns the value kth from the end of the array.

## [Merge Linked Lists](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Challenges/LinkedLists/LinkedList_Merge)
Create a static method that merges two Linked Lists, "zipping" their values together, and returns the merged list.

## [Stacks and Queues](https://github.com/RickFlinn/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/Data-Structures/StacksNQueues/StacksAndQueues)

Defines standalone Classes for Stacks and Queues.
